# Airbnb Data Analysis

Introduction: The Airbnb dataset comprises three tables: calendar, listings, and reviews. These tables contain detailed information about Airbnb listings, their availability, pricing, host information, and guest reviews. The objective of this project is to perform an insightful analysis of the Airbnb data using SQL queries.

Importance of the Project: Analyzing the Airbnb dataset is crucial for various stakeholders involved in the hospitality industry, including hosts, guests, and Airbnb itself. By extracting meaningful insights from the data, hosts can optimize their pricing strategies, guests can make informed booking decisions, and Airbnb can enhance its platform based on user behaviours and preferences.
